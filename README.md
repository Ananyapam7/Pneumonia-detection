# Pneumonia-detection
This is a computational project done as a part of the Cell Imaging Lab. 

The first part of the project includes data exploration and some preliminary image analysis and processing. 

For building the classification model, I used the VGG-16 architecure and I simply let the weights of the first two layers remain the same and trained the remaining  layers. 
Using this kind of a partial transfer learning approach, the model gave state-of-the-art results.
